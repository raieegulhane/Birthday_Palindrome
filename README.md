# Birthday_Palindrome


DESCRIPTION:
- A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward and forward.
- The app takes in date and checks if it is pallindrome. 
- For example 02-02-2020 is a palindromic date.
- 6 date formats are considered, and each one checked to see if it is palindrome or not.
- If the date is not a palindrome then the next and previous palindromic date is displayed.
- App is made with VanillaJs and deployed on Netlify.
